This document will outline how to run Shimi files using the terminal:

First, you will need to activate the virtual environment. For this current iteration of Shimi, the proper code to activate is this:

source ~/python3-env/shimi/bin/activate

Next you will have to locate the file using cd. For this folder use:

cd Documents/shimi-master/Sean

In order to get permission to work with Shimi's motors, you will need to change the execution of a certain dev part:

sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

From here, you can use python3 in the terminal and input from there or run a file using:

python3 ./filename
